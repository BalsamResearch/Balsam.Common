### Backtester
The Backtester is a suite of tools designed to allow for rapid prototyping and testing of systematic trading strategies. It can run simple event studies to quantify market "edges" all the way to full blown multi-currency, multi-timeframe, multi-strategy portfolio simulations. Written in C#, it can be called from any .NET language and can serve as a general toolbox underlying many market related applications.
